# English-Swedish-dictionary
A basic dictionary that translates English word/phrases to their Swedish equivalents.
The dictionary reads from a .txt file, and the dictionary searches through the keys within the .txt file to match the users word they're searching for.

If the dictionary doesn't contain the word/phrase entered, it give the user the option to add the word in, and save the appendage to the .txt file.

Very basic functionality, and I'll be looking at adding a GUI in the future around my studies :)
